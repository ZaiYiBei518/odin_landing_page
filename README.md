# odin_landing_page
This page is my first attempt at the Odin Project's Landing Page.

This page demonstrates that I have learned the basic functions of flexbox.

In addtion, the project continues to test my html and css ability.

I will compare my code with others and add comments for things that I could improve on.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.
